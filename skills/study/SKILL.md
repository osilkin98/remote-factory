# /factory:study

Analyze the current codebase and generate an observation report with structural graph analysis.

## Prerequisites

```bash
command -v factory >/dev/null 2>&1 || uv tool install "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}"
```

## Execution

```bash
factory graph update "$(pwd)"
factory study "$(pwd)"
```

Check whether a code knowledge graph is available by running `factory graph status "$(pwd)"`.

If the graph is available (status shows node/edge counts), explore the code graph:

```bash
factory graph query "$(pwd)" "<focus from observations>" --depth 2
factory graph explain "$(pwd)" "<key node>"
factory graph path "$(pwd)" "<A>" "<B>"
```

Write graph findings to `.factory/strategy/graph-context.md`, then combine:

```bash
cat .factory/strategy/observations.md .factory/strategy/graph-context.md \
  > .factory/strategy/study-combined.md
```

The combined report at `.factory/strategy/study-combined.md` covers:

- **Eval scores** — current composite and per-dimension breakdown
- **Open issues** — from GitHub, if available
- **Backlog items** — pending work from `.factory/strategy/backlog.md`
- **Observability coverage** — logging density and uninstrumented files
- **Hypothesis budget** — how many improvements to target this cycle
- **Cross-project insights** — patterns from sibling projects (if any)
- **Structural analysis** — key modules, dependency paths, architectural layers, entry points

For cross-project insights, pass `--projects-dir`:

```bash
factory study "$(pwd)" --projects-dir ~/factory-projects
```

After studying, use `/factory:implement` to act on the findings.
