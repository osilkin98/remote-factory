# Design Workflow

The user wants: **$ARGUMENTS**

## Phase 1: Research (Parallel)

Spawn 3 agents in parallel:

```bash
factory agent researcher --review-tag similar --task "Similar projects research. Search the web for similar projects, existing solutions, and prior art. Analyze their strengths, weaknesses, and market positioning. Check .factory/archive/ for prior knowledge on similar builds. Write findings to .factory/strategy/research-similar.md covering: similar projects found (with links), what they do well and what's missing, differentiation opportunities.
Write output to: .factory/strategy/research-similar.md" --project "$PROJECT_PATH" --timeout 600 &
```

```bash
factory agent researcher --review-tag techstack --task "Tech stack research. Identify the best technology stack for this type of project. Find architecture patterns and best practices. Evaluate framework/library options with trade-offs. Write findings to .factory/strategy/research-techstack.md covering: recommended tech stack with rationale, architecture patterns, framework comparisons.
Write output to: .factory/strategy/research-techstack.md" --project "$PROJECT_PATH" --timeout 600 &
```

```bash
factory agent researcher --review-tag pitfalls --task "Pitfalls and scope research. Identify potential pitfalls and common mistakes for this type of project. Research MVP scope best practices. Check .factory/archive/ for lessons from past builds. Write findings to .factory/strategy/research-pitfalls.md covering: potential pitfalls to avoid, MVP scope recommendation, lessons from similar past builds.
Write output to: .factory/strategy/research-pitfalls.md" --project "$PROJECT_PATH" --timeout 600 &
```

```bash
wait
```

## Barrier: Research

Wait for all parallel agents to complete: `researcher_similar`, `researcher_techstack`, `researcher_pitfalls`

Read combined outputs: `.factory/strategy/research-pitfalls.md`, `.factory/strategy/research-similar.md`, `.factory/strategy/research-techstack.md`

Write combined result to: `.factory/strategy/research-combined.md`

### CEO Review — Research

Apply the CEO Review Gate protocol:
1. Read the agent output for the preceding step
2. Read artifacts: `.factory/strategy/research-combined.md`
3. Assess: Is the research relevant? Does it cover the technology landscape adequately? Check for gaps in similar projects, tech stack analysis, and pitfall coverage.
4. Write verdict to `.factory/reviews/ceo-verdict-research.md`
5. **PROCEED** → continue to next step
6. **REDIRECT** → re-invoke the preceding agent with corrections (max 2)
7. **ABORT** → log failure and skip to archival

*On RELOOP: return to `fork_research` (max 3 iterations)*

## Phase 2: Strategist

```bash
factory agent strategist --task "Synthesize a project specification from research. Read ALL tagged research files at .factory/strategy/research-*.md. Produce a complete phased build plan. Phase 1 must be project scaffold + eval harness. Every Phase must have substantive What/Why/Expected impact fields. Build EVERYTHING in this pass. Only defer items requiring human intervention. Write the plan to .factory/strategy/current.md.
Read: .factory/strategy/research-combined.md
Write output to: .factory/strategy/current.md" --project "$PROJECT_PATH" --timeout 600
```

### Steering Point — Strategy (User Approval)

Present findings to the user. Wait for approval or feedback.
- **Approve** → proceed to next step
- **Feedback** → re-run the previous step with corrections

*On RELOOP: return to `strategist` (max 3 iterations)*

## Phase 3: Archivist Plan

```bash
factory agent archivist --task "Archive the approved research and strategy.
Read: .factory/strategy/current.md
Write output to: .factory/archive/plan.md" --project "$PROJECT_PATH" --timeout 300 --model haiku &
```
*(fire-and-forget — CEO continues immediately)*

## Phase 4: Builder

```bash
factory agent builder --task "Implement the next phase from .factory/strategy/current.md. Read the CEO's plan approval at .factory/reviews/ceo-verdict-strategist.md. Read CLAUDE.md and factory.md if they exist. Implement exactly what the current phase describes. Run tests. Commit changes and open a draft PR.
Read: .factory/strategy/current.md
Write output to: .factory/reviews/builder-latest.md" --project "$PROJECT_PATH" --timeout 1200
```

### CEO Review — Build

Apply the CEO Review Gate protocol:
1. Read the agent output for the preceding step
2. Read artifacts: `.factory/reviews/builder-latest.md`
3. Assess: Read builder output. Check git log and diff. Does the work match the plan for this phase? If the Builder opened a PR, read it. REDIRECT if off-scope or missed key requirements.
4. Write verdict to `.factory/reviews/ceo-verdict-build.md`
5. **PROCEED** → continue to next step
6. **REDIRECT** → re-invoke the preceding agent with corrections (max 2)
7. **ABORT** → log failure and skip to archival

*On RELOOP: return to `builder` (max 3 iterations)*

## Phase 5: Qa

```bash
factory agent qa --task "Run health check (factory eval + score delta), code review (correctness, architecture, edge cases, security), and adversarial QA (run/test the built feature). Write results to .factory/reviews/qa-latest.md
Read: .factory/reviews/builder-latest.md
Write output to: .factory/reviews/qa-latest.md" --project "$PROJECT_PATH" --timeout 1800
```

### CEO Review — Qa

Apply the CEO Review Gate protocol:
1. Read the agent output for the preceding step
2. Read artifacts: `.factory/reviews/qa-latest.md`
3. Assess: Review QA results. PROCEED if all checks pass. RELOOP to builder (max 3 iterations) if issues found.
4. Write verdict to `.factory/reviews/ceo-verdict-qa.md`
5. **PROCEED** → continue to next step
6. **REDIRECT** → re-invoke the preceding agent with corrections (max 2)
7. **ABORT** → log failure and skip to archival

*On RELOOP: return to `builder` (max 3 iterations)*

### Gate — Precheck (Automated)

```bash
factory precheck $PROJECT_PATH --score-before 0 --score-after 0
```

- **PROCEED** → continue to `archivist_build`

If gate fails: the change violated a constraint or score regressed. Route to `archivist_build` for error handling.

## Phase 6: Archivist Build

```bash
factory agent archivist --task "Archive the build phase results.
Read: .factory/reviews/qa-latest.md
Write output to: .factory/archive/build.md" --project "$PROJECT_PATH" --timeout 300 --model haiku &
```
*(fire-and-forget — CEO continues immediately)*
