# Review Workflow

The user wants: **$ARGUMENTS**

## Step: Eval Test

```bash
cd $PROJECT_PATH && python eval/score.py
```

### CEO Review — Eval

Apply the CEO Review Gate protocol:
1. Read the agent output for the preceding step
2. Read artifacts: `.factory/reviews/eval-test-latest.md`
3. Assess: Check eval output. Did all dimensions pass? If any dimension failed, dispatch the Builder to fix it (install missing tool, adjust command, remove broken dimension). PROCEED only when all dimensions produce valid scores.
4. Write verdict to `.factory/reviews/ceo-verdict-eval.md`
5. **PROCEED** → continue to next step
6. **REDIRECT** → re-invoke the preceding agent with corrections (max 2)
7. **ABORT** → log failure and skip to archival

*On RELOOP: return to `eval_test` (max 3 iterations)*

## Step: Mark Reviewed

```bash
python3 -c "import json; from pathlib import Path; p = Path('$PROJECT_PATH/.factory/eval_profile.json'); d = json.loads(p.read_text()); d['human_reviewed'] = True; p.write_text(json.dumps(d, indent=2))"
```

## Phase 1: Ceo — Create Factory Md

```bash
factory agent ceo --task "Create factory.md from template. Copy the factory config template to the project root. Fill in: Goal, Scope, Guards, Eval command, Threshold, and Smoke Test. If .factory/eval_spec.json exists, populate the Eval Spec section. If .factory/strategy/current.md has a Research Configuration section, populate research sections (Research Target, Mutable/Fixed Surfaces, etc.).
Read: .factory/eval_profile.json
Write output to: factory.md" --project "$PROJECT_PATH" --timeout 3600
```

## Step: Factory Init

```bash
factory init $PROJECT_PATH
```

## Step: Baseline Eval

```bash
factory eval $PROJECT_PATH
```

## Step: Commit

```bash
cd $PROJECT_PATH && git add factory.md eval/score.py .factory/ && git commit -m "factory: initialize factory config and baseline eval"
```

### CEO Review — E2E

Apply the CEO Review Gate protocol:
1. Read the agent output for the preceding step
2. Read artifacts: `.factory/config.json`, `factory.md`
3. Assess: E2E verification gate. Verify the project runs end-to-end. Check the Smoke Test command in factory.md and run it. If this is a pre-existing project entering the factory for the first time, it MUST be verified before transitioning to Improve mode.
4. Write verdict to `.factory/reviews/ceo-verdict-e2e.md`
5. **PROCEED** → continue to next step
6. **REDIRECT** → re-invoke the preceding agent with corrections (max 2)
7. **ABORT** → log failure and skip to archival
