# Research Workflow

The user wants: **$ARGUMENTS**

## Step: Baseline

```bash
factory eval $PROJECT_PATH
```

## Phase 1: Failure Analyst

```bash
factory agent failure_analyst --task "Analyze research run results. Read run artifacts at .factory/research/runs/. Read research target config from .factory/config.json. Classify failures by type and severity. Compute failure distribution. Suggest interventions within mutable surfaces only. Write to .factory/strategy/failure_analysis.md.
Read: .factory/experiments/baseline.json
Write output to: .factory/strategy/failure_analysis.md" --project "$PROJECT_PATH" --timeout 600
```

## Phase 2: Researcher

```bash
factory agent researcher --task "Failure-targeted research. Read failure analysis at .factory/strategy/failure_analysis.md. Search the web for solutions to the dominant failure modes. Check .factory/archive/ for prior knowledge on these patterns. Write findings to .factory/strategy/research-local.md.
Read: .factory/strategy/failure_analysis.md
Write output to: .factory/strategy/research-local.md" --project "$PROJECT_PATH" --timeout 600
```

### CEO Review — Research

Apply the CEO Review Gate protocol:
1. Read the agent output for the preceding step
2. Read artifacts: `.factory/strategy/research-local.md`
3. Assess: Are observations grounded in data? Did web research surface useful patterns? Any blind spots in the analysis?
4. Write verdict to `.factory/reviews/ceo-verdict-research.md`
5. **PROCEED** → continue to next step
6. **REDIRECT** → re-invoke the preceding agent with corrections (max 2)
7. **ABORT** → log failure and skip to archival

*On RELOOP: return to `researcher` (max 3 iterations)*

## Phase 3: Strategist

```bash
factory agent strategist --task "Generate research hypotheses targeting dominant failure modes. Each hypothesis must improve over the previous baseline score. Each hypothesis must name specific files from mutable_surfaces to modify. Hypotheses MUST NOT modify files in fixed_surfaces. Prioritize by expected impact on the target metric. Write 1-3 hypotheses to .factory/strategy/current.md.
Read: .factory/strategy/failure_analysis.md, .factory/strategy/research-local.md
Write output to: .factory/strategy/current.md" --project "$PROJECT_PATH" --timeout 600
```

### CEO Review — Strategy

Apply the CEO Review Gate protocol:
1. Read the agent output for the preceding step
2. Read artifacts: `.factory/strategy/current.md`
3. Assess: HARD GATE. Check: specific enough to implement? Scoped to one PR? Expected eval impact realistic? Follows FEEC priority? Not redundant with reverted experiment? At least one growth hypothesis? Backlog convergence? Write PLAN APPROVED with approved hypotheses in priority order.
4. Write verdict to `.factory/reviews/ceo-verdict-strategy.md`
5. **PROCEED** → continue to next step
6. **REDIRECT** → re-invoke the preceding agent with corrections (max 2)
7. **ABORT** → log failure and skip to archival

*On RELOOP: return to `strategist` (max 3 iterations)*

## Step: Begin

```bash
factory begin $PROJECT_PATH --hypothesis "$HYPOTHESIS"
```

## Phase 4: Builder

```bash
factory agent builder --task "Implement the current hypothesis from .factory/strategy/current.md. Read CLAUDE.md and factory.md. Read the CEO strategy approval. Implement exactly what the hypothesis describes. Run tests. Commit and open a draft PR.
Read: .factory/strategy/current.md
Write output to: .factory/reviews/builder-latest.md" --project "$PROJECT_PATH" --timeout 1200
```

### CEO Review — Build

Apply the CEO Review Gate protocol:
1. Read the agent output for the preceding step
2. Read artifacts: `.factory/reviews/builder-latest.md`
3. Assess: Read builder output and PR diff. Does work match the hypothesis? No scope creep? Tests included? REDIRECT if off-scope.
4. Write verdict to `.factory/reviews/ceo-verdict-build.md`
5. **PROCEED** → continue to next step
6. **REDIRECT** → re-invoke the preceding agent with corrections (max 2)
7. **ABORT** → log failure and skip to archival

*On RELOOP: return to `builder` (max 3 iterations)*

## Phase 5: Qa

```bash
factory agent qa --task "Run health check (factory eval + score delta), code review (correctness, architecture, edge cases, security), adversarial QA (run/test the built feature), and verify mutable/fixed surface constraint compliance. Write results to .factory/reviews/qa-latest.md
Read: .factory/reviews/builder-latest.md
Write output to: .factory/reviews/qa-latest.md" --project "$PROJECT_PATH" --timeout 1800
```

### CEO Review — Qa

Apply the CEO Review Gate protocol:
1. Read the agent output for the preceding step
2. Read artifacts: `.factory/reviews/qa-latest.md`
3. Assess: Review QA results. PROCEED if all checks pass. RELOOP to builder (max 3 iterations) if issues found.
4. Write verdict to `.factory/reviews/ceo-verdict-qa.md`
5. **PROCEED** → continue to next step
6. **REDIRECT** → re-invoke the preceding agent with corrections (max 2)
7. **ABORT** → log failure and skip to archival

*On RELOOP: return to `builder` (max 3 iterations)*

### Gate — Precheck (Automated)

```bash
factory precheck $PROJECT_PATH --score-before 0 --score-after 0
```

- **PROCEED** → continue to `finalize`

If gate fails: the change violated a constraint or score regressed. Route to `archivist` for error handling.

## Step: Finalize

```bash
factory finalize $PROJECT_PATH --id $EXP_ID --verdict $VERDICT --hypothesis "$HYPOTHESIS"
```

## Phase 6: Archivist

```bash
factory agent archivist --task "Archive experiment results and learnings.
Read: .factory/experiments/verdict.json
Write output to: .factory/archive/experiment.md" --project "$PROJECT_PATH" --timeout 300 --model haiku &
```
*(fire-and-forget — CEO continues immediately)*

### Gate — Plateau Gate (Automated)

```bash
python3 -c "import json, pathlib, sys; tsv = pathlib.Path('$PROJECT_PATH/.factory/results.tsv'); lines = [l for l in tsv.read_text().strip().splitlines()[1:] if l.strip()] if tsv.exists() else []; scores = []; [scores.append(float(p)) for l in lines for i, p in enumerate(l.split(chr(9))) if i == 2 and p]; recent = scores[-3:] if len(scores) >= 3 else scores; improved = len(recent) < 2 or recent[-1] > recent[-2]; print('RELOOP' if improved else 'PROCEED')"
```

*On RELOOP: return to `baseline` (max 3 iterations)*
