"""Resolving how a contained run reaches inference — by shape, never by material.

The container holds credential material directly — nothing outside it terminates inference on its
behalf. Since that cannot be avoided, the next best thing is to name exactly what crosses and refuse
to guess anything else.

Three supported shapes, all explicit:

| Backend       | What crosses the boundary                                             |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Anthropic API | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`                                                   |
| Vertex        | `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_VERTEX`, `CLOUD_ML_REGION`, `ANTHROPIC_VERTEX_PROJECT_ID`, plus ADC by mounting `~/.config/gcloud` read-only |
| Profile       | nothing — a `[credentials.<name>]` section in the mounted `~/.factory/config.toml` is already inside |

A shape's `detail` reports which backend, which model, and which variable or file supplied it. It
never prints material: a check whose purpose is configuration must not become a way to print a key.
