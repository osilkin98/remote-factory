"""Scanning a workspace for secrets before it leaves the machine.

The k8s path copies a developer's working tree onto cluster storage, and a `.env` or a stray key
file goes with it. [Gitleaks](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks) runs over the packed tree —
regex-based, fully offline, no network calls, which matters for a step whose whole purpose is
preventing exposure.

**Warn and confirm, not block.** A false positive on a test fixture must not stop work, because an
override people use reflexively protects nobody. `--yes` skips the prompt for automation and is
recorded in the run's evidence. When gitleaks is absent, `verify` says so and the upload warns that
it is unscanned rather than silently proceeding.

Not applied to the local target: nothing leaves the machine there, and a confirmation prompt people
learn to dismiss on every local run devalues the one that matters.
