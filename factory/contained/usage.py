"""Which runtimes this machine actually uses.

`ls` shows one table covering both targets, which is right for someone who uses both and wrong for
everyone else: reaching a cluster costs a network round trip, and an unreachable one costs a
multi-second timeout followed by an error about a target the user never asked for. Somebody who
answered "local" at setup should not be told their cluster is down.

So the cluster is only consulted when there is a reason to think it is wanted: the user set it up,
has run something on it, or asked for it now with `--target k8s`. The record is a plain list of
target names, written when a target is set up or provisioned.
