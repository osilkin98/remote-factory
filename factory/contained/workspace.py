"""Materializing the tree a contained run works on.

A run never writes the host's working tree. It works on a copy, bind-mounted at *its own* absolute
path — identical inside and out — which is what lets the local division's builds resolve a
Containerfile on the host and read what the agent actually wrote. Those builds are executed by an
engine outside the container, which resolves the context path in its own filesystem
namespace; mounting the copy at the *original* path instead would give the agent one tree and the
build another, and the divergence surfaces as "file not found" for a file the agent can plainly see.

The copy always starts from the files on this machine, uncommitted changes included.
Git projects get a worktree from HEAD — cheap, sharing the object store, and the run's work is
already on a branch when it comes back — and the working tree is then synced over the top, because
the whole point of a contained run is to exercise code that is not committed yet. Everything else
is rsynced.

Copies live under `~/.factory-contained/`, deliberately not under `~/.factory/`, which is itself
bind-mounted read-write — nesting them would produce overlapping bind mounts.

    worktree is added, nothing is rsynced. The one filesystem interaction that survives is the git
    repo check, a read-only `rev-parse` that decides `worktree` vs. `copy`; it changes nothing.

    **`self_contained` is what the cluster target needs, and it is not an optimization.** A git
    worktree's `.git` is a *file* pointing at the original repository's object store. Locally that
    store is bind-mounted and everything works; in a pod there is no host to point at, so `git
    status` fails, state detection reports `no_repo`, and the CEO silently drops to build mode —
    the exact failure the `git_usable` probe exists to catch, and it catches it. A plain copy
    carries a real `.git` directory and stands on its own. The worktree's advantages — cheap,
    shared object store, work already on a branch — are all host-side, and the cluster brings its
