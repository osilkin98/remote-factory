"""`ls`, `attach`, `rm`, `sync` — over runtimes the factory created, and only those.

A tool that lists resources it did not create invites the user to assume it manages them too, so
every subcommand here filters on the factory's own label and refuses a name that does not carry it.
`resolve_runtime` returning `None` is the enforcement point: `attach`, `remove`, and `sync` all go
through it before touching anything.

`ls` is the one command that spans both targets — one table, local and cluster together — because a
user asking "what is running?" does not want to ask it twice. Everything else acts on a single
named runtime and takes its target from `--target`.
