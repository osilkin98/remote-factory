"""What must be true before a contained run can work, and how to make it true.

Three checks locally: container engine, runtime image, inference.

Every failing check carries the command that resolves it. A check that can detect a problem can
almost always name its remedy; one that cannot says so explicitly.

Nothing here may raise. `shutil.which` gates every subprocess call and `_run` swallows
`FileNotFoundError`/`OSError`, because "nothing installed yet" is the normal case this module exists
to describe, not an error condition — a clean machine must get a list of what is missing, not a
traceback.
