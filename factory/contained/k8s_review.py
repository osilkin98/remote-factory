"""Walking the bundle object by object, against what the namespace already has.

Printing the whole bundle and asking "apply them?" asks the wrong question. Most of those objects
usually already exist, and the user cannot tell which — so the choice on offer is between "yes" and
"no" to a wall of YAML whose relationship to their cluster is unknown. What they actually need to
decide is, for each object that is *not* already right: what is this for, what would change, and do
I want it in my namespace.

So this establishes the current state first, then walks only the difference. Three states matter
and they are genuinely different decisions:

- **absent** — it would be created. The manifest is the whole story.
- **differs** — it exists and does not match. The *diff* is the story; the manifest is noise.
- **current** — nothing to decide. Reported once in the summary and never asked about, because a
  prompt whose only sane answer is "yes" trains people to stop reading prompts.

`oc diff` does the comparison server-side, which is the only way to get this right: it applies the
same merge the real apply would, so a field the cluster defaults in does not read as a change the
user is about to make.
