"""Getting a machine (or a namespace) ready to run `factory contained`, in one pass.

`verify` reports; `setup` fixes. It ends in exactly one of two states — everything green with a
runnable command printed, or the full list of what is still missing with the command for each.
Never in between.

Two properties make it safe to run at any time:

- **Idempotent.** Re-running changes nothing that is already correct, so it is also the supported
  way to repair a partial setup and nothing needs to be torn down first.
- **Nothing silent.** Every step announces what it will do before doing it, and steps that touch
  credentials or a cluster ask first.

What is automated locally is deliberately narrow: starting a stopped podman machine and pulling the
runtime image. Inference is never automated — it is the one step that touches credential material,
so it is described and left to the user.
