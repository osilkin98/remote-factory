"""Translating host paths in a passthrough command into their in-runtime equivalents.

The runtime does not share the host's filesystem layout, so a path in the passthrough command may
name something that does not exist inside. Teaching the host every subcommand's arguments is not an
option — a passthrough that second-guesses its payload breaks whenever the CLI grows — so one
generic rule applies instead: an argument that *resolves to an existing host path at or under the
project root* is translated; everything else is passed through untouched.

A path outside the project root is deliberately left alone. It will not exist in the runtime and the
command fails inside with a plain "no such file", which is the honest outcome: `--mount` is how such
a path is made available on purpose.

Locally the rewrite is usually a no-op, because the workspace copy is bind-mounted at its own
absolute path — identical inside and out. That is not a reason to skip it: the payload
still names the *original* project path, which is a different directory from the copy, and the k8s
target rewrites to `/workspace/<name>` where nothing coincides.
