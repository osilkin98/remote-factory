"""Which environment variables cross into a contained run, and what is masked when one is printed.

Credential material genuinely crosses into the runtime: nothing outside it terminates inference on
its behalf. `CLAUDE_CODE_*` and `CLOUD_ML_*` have to cross for the Vertex path to work, and
`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` for the direct one.

So the policy is: `FACTORY_` by default, plus exactly what `--forward` names, plus the backend
variables the resolved credential shape requires (`factory.contained.credentials`). Nothing
implicit — a variable that is not in one of those three sets does not cross, and the three sets are
each visible at the call site rather than accumulated by prefix matching.
