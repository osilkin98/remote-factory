"""Kubernetes/OpenShift integration — composing the commands and manifests for a cluster run.

Everything that knows the `kubectl`/`oc` CLI lives here, for the same reason `factory/podman.py`
exists: the surface is external and moves independently, and one file to fix is the difference
between a version bump and an archaeology session. The factory shells out rather than adding a
Kubernetes client library — that matches how the local target shells out to podman, and it supplies
`exec -it`, `cp` and `port-forward` for free.

Two shapes are worth reading before the code.

**The workspace arrives as one tarball, not as a directory copy.** `oc cp` of a tree is one API
round trip per file and is painfully slow on a repository. Instead the pod carries an initContainer
that blocks until the workspace has been unpacked into the PVC, the host streams a single tarball
into that initContainer over `exec -i`, and the initContainer then exits and lets the factory
container start. The wait loop is what makes the ordering work at all: an initContainer that is
waiting is *running*, and a running container is one you can exec into.

**The pod is a plain pod under the restricted SCC.** No privileged flags, no host mounts, no
capabilities. The workspace is a copy on a PVC that survives pod restart, eviction and node drain,
so a multi-hour run is recoverable.

def sidecar_command() -> str:
    """The sidecar's loop: watch the shared volume for a request, start a Build, write the result.

    Lives here, beside `loader_command` and the manifest that embeds it, for the same reason: it is
    a container's `command:` in this pod spec. Holding it in `k8s_division` — which is the *client*
    side, the file drop the agent talks to — made this module import that one while that one already
    imports this, and the cycle only survived by deferring the import into a function body.

    Deliberately dumb. It never evaluates anything from the request beyond a Containerfile path and
    a tag, because the agent writes those files and the sidecar is the thing holding the credentials
    the agent must not have. `oc start-build --from-dir` is what carries the context — a binary
    source build, so there is no ConfigMap size ceiling and no fresh host-side upload per iteration.

    Parsed with `sed` rather than `jq`: the sidecar image is an `oc` image, not the factory runtime,
    and it carries neither jq nor python. Depending on a tool the image happens not to have fails at
    the first build with `command not found`, which reads as a broken division rather than as a
    missing package.

    **The verdict comes from the Build's own phase, never from an exit code.** `oc start-build
    --follow` exits 0 for a build that failed, so trusting it reports a build that produced no
    image as succeeding — and the agent then validates something that does not exist. The build is
    started, its logs are followed for the transcript, and then `.status.phase` is read and required
    to be `Complete`.

    **The Containerfile path is set on the BuildConfig, not passed as a build argument.** Binary
    builds reject build args outright (`oc` warns and ignores them), so `--build-arg DOCKERFILE=`
    silently did nothing and the build looked for a file named `Dockerfile` that was not there.
    `dockerfilePath` is the field that actually selects it, and it is patched per request because
    the agent may name a different file on the next iteration.
