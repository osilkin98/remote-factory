"""The local container-manufacturing plane — opt-in via `--division`.

The division gives the contained agent the *host's* podman engine, so it can build an image, run it,
read the failure and iterate.

**Why the builds happen outside the container.** The runtime container has no container engine of
its own, and giving it one means nested containerization — which needs a privileged container or a
user-namespace configuration that is fragile on Linux and unavailable inside the macOS podman
machine. So the division reaches outward, and it is opt-in and separately named for exactly that
reason.

**What that costs, stated plainly.** For the life of the run, anything that can reach port 8430 can
build and run containers on the host, on every network interface. `podman-mcp-server` has no
authentication and nothing enforces access in front of it, so the mitigation is disclosure rather
than technology: a warning that names the bind address and the exposure, and a shutdown tied to the
run rather than left to chance.

Four mechanical details, each of which fails silently if got wrong:

- The server speaks **Streamable HTTP** (`--port 8430`, endpoint `/mcp`) — it is not a stdio server.
- It nonetheless **exits when stdin reaches EOF**, even in HTTP mode, which is why a naive
  background spawn leaves nothing listening and writes no error. `server_argv` gives it a writer
  that never writes and never exits.
- The address the *container* must use for "the host" is platform-dependent. On macOS the container
  runs inside the podman machine VM, so podman's own `host.containers.internal` may resolve to the
  VM's gateway rather than to macOS. `probe_host_alias` asks rather than assumes. (Probed on this
  machine — macOS, libkrun, rootful — all three candidates reach a server bound on the host.)
- **The server must outlive the command that started it**, which is the one place this module
  departs from a literal reading of. The launch returns as soon as the detached tmux session
  exists, by design, while the run continues for minutes or hours; a server whose lifetime
  was the launcher's would be gone before the agent's first build. So it is detached into its own
  process group, its PGID is recorded next to the workspace, and `factory contained rm` stops it.

# Container division — you can build and run images

This run has the container-manufacturing plane enabled. **This is a capability you already have,
not something to build.** Do not write a CLI wrapper around podman; call the tools.

## The tools

They are registered as `mcp__{server}__*` and cover the whole podman surface: build an image, run a
container, read its logs, stop it, remove it, inspect it, list images and containers, pull, push.

## The loop

1. **build** — `image_build` with a Containerfile and a tag. The build context is a path on the
   host, and your workspace is mounted at the same absolute path inside and out, so the path you
   can see is the path the build engine resolves.
2. **run** — start a container on the tag you just built.
3. **read** — fetch its logs. This is the step that tells you whether the image actually works,
   as opposed to whether it built.
4. **fix** — edit the Containerfile or the source, and go back to 1.

A build that succeeds is not evidence that the image runs. Always complete the loop.

## What is true about this environment

- Builds execute on the **host's** engine, outside this container. They are not confined by it.
- Images you build land in the host's image store and are visible to `podman images` there.
- The endpoint is unauthenticated and lives only for the length of this run.
- You cannot reach the cluster from here. This division is the host's engine, nothing else.
