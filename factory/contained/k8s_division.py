"""The cluster container-manufacturing plane — `--target k8s --division`.

OpenShift only, detected by **API presence** rather than by the `oc` binary: a cluster is not
OpenShift because someone installed a CLI, and the refusal has to name the reason at launch rather
than after a Build that will never be admitted.

**Builds go through OpenShift `Build` objects.** The platform's build controller holds the
privileges OpenShift reserves for building. Rootless buildah, kaniko and buildkit all depend on the
`uid_map` write these nodes deny — probed to the bottom, and not a manifest problem. Output goes to
the cluster-internal registry; the validation pod pulls from
`image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000` and push credentials stay with the build service
account.

**The agent reaches the cluster only through MCP.** `kubernetes-mcp-server` runs inside the pod over
stdio, and `oc` is not in the image — which is what makes the tool allowlist a boundary rather than
a decoration. Unlike the local division, this boundary is enforced by RBAC and by the absence of any
shell path to the cluster, rather than by a filter the agent's own process could bypass.

**The build context reaches the Build through a sidecar.** A ConfigMap-carried context has a ~700KB
ceiling that forces a wheel-only build; a sidecar sharing the PVC has none. The sidecar is a
*separate container* — never a process beside the agent — and it is the only holder of `oc` and the
ServiceAccount token. That separation is a boundary only while the Role excludes `pods/exec`; with
that verb the agent execs into the sidecar and recovers the shell. `k8s_setup._no_exec_check`
asserts its absence, and it is the one check that fails when something succeeds.

# Cluster division — you can build images and validate them

This run has the cluster container-manufacturing plane enabled. **These are capabilities you
already have, not things to build.** Do not write a CLI wrapper, and do not look for `oc` — it is
deliberately not in this image.

## The tools

- `mcp__{build_server}__start_build(dockerfile, tag)` — submit a build of this workspace.
- `mcp__{cluster_server}__*` — read the cluster: list pods, read logs, create and delete the
  validation pods you need. Namespace-scoped, and the namespace is already selected.

## The loop

1. **submit** — `start_build` with the Containerfile's path **relative to your project directory**
   and a tag. Your project directory is the build context, so a relative `COPY` resolves the way it
   would on a laptop. A sidecar container reads the context off the shared volume and starts an
   OpenShift `Build`; you never touch the build machinery yourself.
2. **read the result** — the call blocks until the build finishes and returns the build log plus
   whether it succeeded. Success means the Build reached `Complete`, not merely that a command
   exited zero.
3. **fix** — a build that fails tells you why in that log and nowhere else. Edit the Containerfile
   or the source and resubmit; resubmitting is cheap and is the intended way to iterate.
4. **validate** — when the build succeeds, run a **validation pod** on the resulting image and read
   its logs. A build that succeeds is not evidence that the image runs.

## What is true about this environment

- Images land in the cluster-internal registry at `{registry}`. Reference them from a validation
  pod by their ImageStream tag; push credentials stay with the build service account and never
  reach you.
- You may create **validation pods only** — run a pod on an image you built, read its logs, delete
  it. No Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps, Secrets or RBAC.
- **Label every pod you create `{run_label}: {run_name}`.** That label is how the run sweeps up
  after itself; a pod without it survives the run and is nobody's to clean up.
- You cannot exec into other pods. That is deliberate, and it is what keeps the build sidecar a
  boundary rather than a formality.
