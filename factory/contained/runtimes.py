"""The runtime record — one shape for a podman container and for a cluster pod.

This lives apart from `lifecycle` because both sides of the boundary need it and neither is
below the other: `lifecycle` builds these records from podman and `k8s` builds them from the
cluster, while `lifecycle` in turn asks `k8s` for the cluster half of `ls`. Holding the type in
either module makes that mutual, and the import then has to be deferred into a function body to
survive — a workaround that hides a genuinely circular dependency rather than removing it.

# "finished" is this tool's own word, not an engine's: `lifecycle._run_state` reports it for a
# container that is still up while every pane in its tmux session is dead — the run is over. Since
# the container is *designed* to outlive its run (`--init` around `sleep infinity`), that is what a
# completed local run looks like essentially always; "exited" is the rare case. Leaving it out made
# `reap_stale` refuse the very containers it exists to reap, and made `rm` ask "still active
# (state=finished). Delete anyway?" about the one state where deleting is unambiguously safe.
