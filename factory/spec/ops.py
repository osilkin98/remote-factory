Validate this SPEC.md against the project at {project_path}.

## SPEC.md
{spec_content}

## Checks to perform
1. For each module with a declared path, verify the path exists on disk
2. For modules with declared dependencies, spot-check that actual imports match
3. Flag orphan modules (no other module depends on them or lists them as consumed_by)
4. Check that these sections are non-empty: Problem Statement, Goals, Non-Goals, \
Design Philosophy, Configuration, Security, Extension Points, Implementation Checklist
5. For entity names in the Domain Model section, verify matching classes exist in source
6. Check that module behavioral specs use RFC 2119 normative language (MUST, SHOULD, etc.)
7. If the spec contains [[graph:...]] entity references, verify they resolve to actual \
nodes in the code knowledge graph

## Output
Write a Markdown validation report with sections for Errors and Warnings.
Errors = blocking issues (path not found, critical structural problems).
Warnings = advisory (missing sections, orphan modules, missing normative language).

End the report with exactly one of these verdict lines on its own line:
Verdict: PASS
Verdict: FAIL

Use FAIL if there are any errors, PASS otherwise.
