"""Podman integration — composing the commands that run the factory inside a container.

Everything that knows about the `podman` CLI lives here. That surface is external and moves
independently of the factory, so keeping it in one file means one place to fix when it changes.

The module **composes** command lines and does not execute them; execution and error handling live
in `factory.cli.contained`. That split is what makes `FACTORY_CONTAINED_DRY_RUN=1` honest — dry-run
prints the same argv the real path runs, rather than a separate rendering that drifts from it.

Two shapes deserve explanation up front.

**PID 1.** The factory is not a well-behaved init: it spawns agent subprocesses, and a container
whose PID 1 neither forwards signals nor reaps children accumulates zombies and ignores `podman
stop`. So the container is created with `--init` (podman's catatonit becomes PID 1) around a
trivial `sleep infinity`, and the run itself is started afterwards inside tmux. The process tree
then has a supervisor at both levels.

**Why the factory starts via `exec` rather than as the container's command.** The provenance
assertions have to run after the workspace is in place and *before* the first agent call, and to
abort naming the file and the likely cause. Folding them into the container's command would put
their failure inside `podman logs`, where the host has to poll for container death and guess which
assertion broke. Running them as `podman exec` steps between create and run keeps per-probe exit
codes and stderr on the host, which is where the message a user reads is composed.
