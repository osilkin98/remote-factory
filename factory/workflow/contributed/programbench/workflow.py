"""ProgramBench benchmark workflow — adversarial discovery verification loop.

4-node loop: builder → reviewer → gate_verify → auto_merge
RELOOP from gate_verify back to builder (max 3 iterations) when the
reviewer finds incorrect or unexplored discoveries.

Designed for Harbor containers where:
- A compiled binary exists at /workspace/executable
- The builder probes, implements, AND maintains a structured discoveries file
- The reviewer adversarially validates each discovery against the ground truth
- Todos drive targeted fixes on RELOOP iterations
- Harbor checks the MAIN branch for changes
- No .factory/ infrastructure (no eval, no experiments, no deep-QA)

            "with corrected evidence as you fix each TODO. "
            "Also check /workspace/test-results.txt — if it exists, read it "
            "for test failure diagnostics and fix any compilation or test "
            "failures reported there.\n\n"
            "4. **Probe the binary systematically** — Run the binary with:\n"

            "   - --help, -h\n"
